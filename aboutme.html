										After learning core database administration skills , I chose to further pursue my career into Infrastructure Database Administration where I excelled in production application environment setup gaining expertise in data modelling and database management and took additional responsibilities to work on Big Data projects that gave me the opportunity to learn
										Hadoop Administration and an exposure to Cloud environment . My curiosity to grow in diverse domain and learning new technologies further pushed me to leap into the AWS Cloud platform as Cloud Analytics Engineer gaining experience in cloud analytical and Data visualization services.<br />
										<p>My experience as Cloud Analytics Engineer with AWS inspired me to pivot my career into Data Analytics .To enhance my skillset portfolio further , I completed an intense bootcamp for Data Analytics from Generation Australia in June-23 where I did
										rigorous coursework in analytical skills like Python and SQL and data visualizations tools like Power BI and Tableau. I'm versatile and a quick learner and is in a process of exploring new skills and improving my knowledge and understanding about different analytical methods
										by my continuous learnings through different channels and working on interesting projects based on real world data and problems.</p>  
										<p>Apart from my technical skills , I'm a passionate art and crafts person who can turn any reusable waste into a beautiful peice of artwork and a cooking enthusiast who is always exploring new recipes. </p>
										I want to blend my experience and analytical skills to create experiences to help businesses better connect with their customers. My ideal role is with a company that shares my values of honesty, strong work ethics, loyalty, and continuous professional development.<p>
