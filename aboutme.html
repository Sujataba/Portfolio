										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p>Hi, my name is Sujata Banerjee. I am a data specialist with over 15 years of experience in leading organizations such as AWS and Amdocs. My proficiency lies in database management, data analysis, and cloud engineering, and I possess advanced skills in analytics and problem-solving using both cloud platforms and on-premises datasets. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Applications and am highly adaptable, analytical, and detail-oriented.</p>									
										<p>I started my journey as a data specialist during my internship as a Sales Data Analyst. This experience helped me learn important skills such as MS-SQL Server and Excel, which I can use to analyze and interpret data to drive growth for businesses. I then moved on to core Oracle Database Administration, where I worked on real-world production databases in a Data Center to improve my skills.
										After mastering the core database administration skills, I pursued Infrastructure Database Administration. I excelled in setting up production application environments and became an expert in SQL, data modeling, and Relational database management. Additionally, I worked on Big Data projects, gaining knowledge about Hadoop Administration and the Cloud environment. My eagerness to gain knowledge and experience in diverse domains and new technologies led me to become a Cloud Analytics Engineer on AWS Cloud platform. In this role, I gained valuable experience in cloud analytical, data visualization, and ETL services, including Amazon Redshift, Amazon Quicksight, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Glue.</p>
										<p>In my previous role as a Cloud Analytics Engineer at AWS, I made the decision to shift my career focus to Data Analytics. To enhance my capabilities, I completed an intensive Data Analytics bootcamp through Generation Australia in June 2023. During this program, I delved into coursework that encompassed vital analytical abilities such as Python and SQL, as well as visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. I pride myself on being adaptable and a fast learner, and I am consistently seeking out new skills and refining my comprehension of various analytical techniques through ongoing education and hands-on experience with real-world data and challenges.</p>  
										<p>Through the pursuit of a variety of interests, I have been able to refine my abilities in several areas, including technology, recycling, and cooking. Drawing on my natural creativity, I have found that I can transform ordinary materials into beautiful works of art, and I enjoy exploring new and innovative recipes in the kitchen. Whether I am designing a unique piece of recycled art or trying out a new culinary creation, I am always excited to push the boundaries of what is possible and to challenge myself to learn and grow as a person. </p>
										<p>My goal is to combine my experience and analytical skills to develop customer experiences that enhance business connections. I am seeking employment with a company that shares my values of integrity, a strong work ethic, loyalty, and ongoing professional growth.<p>
